# MessagePreview
If you paste a link to a discord message, Yag automatically creates a preview of it. From BlackWolf's repo. I recommend getting whatever the current version is instead of this one. [Message_link](https://github.com/BlackWolfWoof/yagpdb-cc/blob/master/Misc/message_link.yag)
  
  # Basic Server Stats
  This works as-is, just change the thumbnail url and the text so it doesn't say AMV Sashimi. You do not need to change Guild ID or anything else.   
  It displays: 
* Server Age (1 year, 3 weeks, etc.)
* Server Creation date (the actual date and time)
* Total Member Count
* Total (currently) online

# Helpme
It's a slightly better written help command for the yag commands I allowed normal users to use. But it's out of date so I wouldn't recommend using this in your server.
  
  # Suggest
  It creates a simple yes/no poll and posts it to a particular channel. Users can only make a poll once per 24 hours.     
  Change the cooldown time if you want, make it global or keep it per user. Otherwise, only change the Channel ID on line 32.
