    "description" (print "# ðŸ“¤ Giving Critique\n\n- Critique is for __constructive__ criticism and __actionable__ feedback.\n\n- Keep it focused on how the editor can improve to reach the goal they are looking for.\n\n- Match the depth of the critique to the editor's desire and/or skill level.\n-# If the editor is looking for feedback only on a specific thing, don't start critiquing others.\n\n# ðŸ“¥ Asking for Critique\n\n### :warning: If you are unwilling to change your video, DO NOT ask for critique!\n**Use <#871735111127793674> if you only want praise and/or are unwilling to change your video(s).**\nCritique is given on the expectation that you are willing to change the way you edited your current or future video(s).\n\n- **Only ask for critique on one video at a time**\n\n- **Ask __specific questions__**\nWhat do *__you__* think could be improved? (timing, flow, story, effects, etc.)\n-# - \"Are these good?\"  and/or \"Is there anything I can improve on?\" are NOT specific questions.\n-# - Something like \"I am trying to do X. Does it come off well in my video? What can I do to make X better?\" gives us a good starting point to provide you with better feedback.\n\n- **Say whether your video has flashing or not**\n-# Just like the rest of the server, flash warnings are required.\n-# Full [VPR](https://bentovid.com/vpr) use is encouraged, but not mandatory.\n\n- **Ping <@&" $critique ">**\nFeedback takes time & effort.\nIt can be several hours before you receive a response.\nThe more vague you are, the less likely people are willing to spend that energy on you." )}}
