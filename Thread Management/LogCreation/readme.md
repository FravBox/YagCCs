# Thread Logging

Sends a post to a specific channel any time a thread is created. Original code is a combination of my & Dei's efforts, but it was Dei's idea and ultimately her code so she gets the credit :)

I have logged the original command here, and at some point in the (hopefully) near future I will edit it to something I'd like to use that matches my other logs.

Note from Dei: The template of the post is meant to mimic how carlbot logs things.
