# I'm not in the YAGPDB support server & I don't code for YAGPDB anymore.
You can still DM me on Discord or start an issue here, but changes are extremely unlikely now. Sorry.

# License
You can use my (@standardquip / Fravbox) code & edit it however you want **except the stuff in server backups & things by people other than me.**     
If another user is credited, you must keep the credit in the code. If the code is in my server backups folder, please ask before using it.

# How To Use
Everything here assumes you can at least read basic code. I tell you what to edit for your server, but some are easier to use than others.     
**Bolded commands are the most useful/finished/easy to use.** 

`server backups` is my personal server backups and aren't useful to outsiders.


<details>
<summary>Basic Starboard</summary>
Simplified starboard/pinboard without all the unecessary fancy crap. Replies to the message that was just moved (without pinging the original user) and quotes the message in the pinboard channel.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Custom Report System</summary>

Updates a really old version of a report system previously found in the official Yag CC repo, because I didn't like how the [current version](https://yagpdb-cc.github.io/moderation/report-system/overview) works.

Includes my version (new) and the original (old) version.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Delete Yag posts</summary>

Delete posts from YAGPDB with an emoji. Has several custom options.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Introductions Channel</b></summary>

Uses buttons and modals (form submission) to post introductions to a channel. Easily allow people to edit their own intros. Deletes intros when people leave the server.
</details>

<details>
<Summary>LeaveBan</summary>
 
If someone is muted or timed out and then leaves while they're still muted/timed out, they are banned.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Ping List</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Prompts</summary>

A very basic system that allows users to submit prompts for writing, art, etc. Yag collects them, randomizes them, and then posts them periodically.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Role-related</summary>

- Give and take role reskins

- Custom  RoleMenu     
    Posts something similar to a role menu that assigns a role on reaction and can automatically remove the role some time after if the user never unreacts.

- Some quick references/templates

</details>

<details><summary><b>Tag System Channel</b></summary>

A tag system that uses a reference channel, buttons, and modals (form submission) so you don't have to deal with text commands. Loosely based on [jo3-l](https://github.com/jo3-l)'s [Tag system](https://yagpdb-cc.github.io/tags/overview) on the YAGPDB-CC website.

Tags (sometimes called "snippets") are pre-formatted messages you can call at any time. They are specifically helpful for support servers where the same questions are asked frequently.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Templates</summary>

Random quick reference for snippets & templates.     
- random chance      
- cooldown      
- cooldown with branching      
- misc quick reference 
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Thread Management</b></summary>
 
 * Thread Pins    
Allows the author of the first message in a thread to manage pins in the thread via post replies.

 * Thread Creation Log     
 Sends a log message to a specific channel when a thread is created

 * Manage pinners
 Allows Thread OPs to assign other people to be able to pin messages in that thread too

 * Mention everyone & here
 Thread OPs can do this through yag

</details>

<details>
<summary>Verification System</summary>

An entire verification system based on reacting with a specific emoji to a specific post. Heavily commented, customizable, and has some picture examples.    
This is probably my most user-friendly code in the repo.

Also has a nice join and leave message template.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Voice Chat Management</summary>

Allows people to "host" in VCs, giving them temporary privileges to mute people. Originally made to allow people to host their own events in stage channels without having to make permanent stage moderators. <br>
In theory this CC works; all parts were tested. But the CC as an entire system is untested. Test it before applying to a public server.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Werewolf Game</summary>
Simple text-based word game where people in a channel try to take care of a werewolf problem. NOT a social deduction game. The bot is the werewolf.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Misc</summary>

- Basic server stats     
- Improved bookmark commands      
- MessagePreview    
</details>

<details>
<summary>Reaction tickets</summary>

VERY Basic "make a ticket when clicking a reaction" command.

</details>

P.S. ~~I don't know how to code at all.~~ I now BARELY know how to code, but most of these are frankensteined together from various publicly available snippets/templates, context clues, and Yag support lmao. So while these all work, they might not be the most efficient.
