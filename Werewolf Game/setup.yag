you need to run this in the werewolf game channel and you should probably limit it so only a mod role can use it.

**To interact with the werewolf:**
You have to use simple commands.
"I/we/the chat" does thing to/at "werewolf"
(Your sentence has to begin with a pronoun and end with werewolf)

If there was no response, that was not one of the commands. 

**Your goal is to get rid of the werewolf**
(It is NOT a social deduction game; the bot is the werewolf)

Every message you make has an impact, even just chatting without actually doing anything to the werewolf.
