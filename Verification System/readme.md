# Verification System

A simple verification system where users react with an emoji to a specific post to recieve a verification role. When the role is recieved, Yag announces the member as having joined the server in the main talk channel.

This command also logs when users have verified into a modlog, and, optionally, will also log incorrect verifications (if a user reacts to the wrong post) and/or delete emoji reactions.    
It supports having different channels for every step of the process.

**You only need the `verification.tmpl` for this code to work. `join.tmpl` and `leave.tmpl` are optional join & leave messages.**
