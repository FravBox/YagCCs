This creates a message with a 🏆 reaction on the message. Anyone who uses that reaction is given a role ("entrant" - You need to change the name/role ID for your server). 
This role is automatically removed in 7 days, or if the user unreacts to the message. 

It also creates a second message right after the first. This 2nd message just says "It's recommended you pin the above message to the top of your channel."
This second message deletes itself after 30 seconds.
