This was bult to have Yag interact with Sesh.fyi event bot. 

Use:
1. Sesh makes an event post    
(at the least: an embed with a title and a unix timestamp)

2. You (a person) uses the `-deadline 1234` command.     
`1234` can be the event post's ID or URL.

3. This CC triggers. It will post the following:    
```
!remind [event embed title] [Date that is 7 days prior to event start date]

Click the bell icon to be DMed a week before [event embed title]!
<[message URL the embed is from]>
```

4. Sesh reacts to Yag's post with a bell emoji.    
(`!remind` is a command Sesh looks for.)

5. People click the emoji to be DMed a reminder of the event 7 days before it happens.


**Why this exists**    
My server posts a lot of deadlines for future competitions, and we needed an extra RSVP reminder at least a week in advance.     
More RSVP reminder options have been on the roadmap for Sesh for an entire year. I decided to abuse the remind function to get what I wanted in a workaround.     
Sesh finally updated to include a 1 week prior reminder. The CC below now does 2 weeks prior.
