Basic snippet command, allows users to assign a staff role with perms to create snippets.

Commands:

;snipname - sends the snippet

;list - lists all snippets - this is broken in AMV Sashimi for some reason. I gave up. If it doesn't work for you either, just make sure to set the option so errors don't display as bot response posts in the server.

;admin <snipname> - deletes snippet

;admin <snipname> <body> - creates/edits snippet

;search <query> - starts a search for specified query

Trigger: StartsWith ;
