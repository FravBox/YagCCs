**Masking**
```markdown
;admin masking/mask/masks **What is masking?**
Masking is when you cut specific parts of one scene (usually a character) and overlay them onto a different background, or an entirely different scene. See the tutorials below for how to do it!

**Flow**
```markdown
;admin flow **Flow in AMVs**
I find it hard to describe flow. It's like the "smoothness" of an edit. I never really noticed it until I went looking for it, and after I learned about it, now it's really obvious when it's not there. 

[An overall explanation and guide to achieving flow](https://youtu.be/J5Jjxb6Lw7s)


**Other common techniques**
- More emphasis on internal sync than external sync
- Using [Ken Burns](https://youtu.be/1t16je0AOXU) (adding motion to clips to make smoother transitions)
- Using masking to make transitions less apparent
- [Match Cuts](https://youtu.be/BPumZgU_-p4) (especially for more action-oriented videos)
- Super advanced: [Twixtor](https://lolligerjoj.wordpress.com/2016/10/22/twixtor-on-anime-footage-and-ae-workflow-using-twixtor/) (only applicable to After Effects)

**More theoretical approaches**
- learn the basics of cinematography and the [types of shots](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/video/tips-and-solutions/filmmaking-101-camera-shot-types)
- learn the importance of [shot selection](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/video/discover/types-of-shots-in-films.html) and how different shots can emotionally impact the viewer

**Watch someone else talking about what makes AMVs good, with examples**
It's about more than just flow, but @CrackTheSky#6960's  [What Makes it Great](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZlNFRNpKKEA-bsX7VTrzoBGAe6UHFPhs) breaks down AMVs and talks about what each one did that made it great.

**Twixtor**
```markdown
;admin twixtor **Twixtor** is a really useful tool for time interpolation and is used to achieve really sexy moments. If you are searching for twixtor tutorials then i guess you already know it's uses and just want to jump into it. For that I present with you the Holy Grail of twixtor tutorials.

Get some coffee and a lot of time, cause this thing is vast, and i mean it.

;admin lossless **__How to encode a lossless AMV for yourself__**
It's considered best practice to make a lossless version of your AMV to keep. You save this lossless version of your AMV and make other versions of the file from it for whatever use you need. That way you have one dedicated "master" file you can work from, without having to export from your editing program every time.

**1. Get the UtVideo codec suite**
It is *highly recommended* you get the [AMVpack](https://www.amv101.com/software/amvpack) from amv101.com. But if you want only the codec pack, you can get it from [here](https://www.videohelp.com/software/Ut-Video-Codec-Suite).

**2. Export to UtVideo AVI from your editing program**
Select AVI as the container and `UtVideo RGB VCM` as the codec or compression format.
If you plan on using [Zarx264gui](http://amvhell.com/stuff/zarx264gui/) at some point, or for some reason you encounter errors with the RGB version of the codec, use `UtVideo YUV422 BT.709 VCM` instead. (zarx won't read the RGB version for some reason).
If you want to learn about colorspaces (which helps explain these codec names), read about them [here](https://www.animemusicvideos.org/guides/avtech31/theory-videocolorspace.html).

**3. Use this lossless file to encode to your desired distribution format.**
