This makes a small embed post that says it will DM you. Then it sends you 2 DMs (because the DMs got to be too long for 1 CC and 1 DM). The text is for the actual Snippet bot, which we don't use anymore.

But I thought it would be useful to keep these commands since... it's a lot. Good for reference on how to send DMs and create embeds inside CCs.
