You can arrange them into categories. \n ``s=ac <category_name>`` will add a new category. \n ``s=dc <category_name>`` deletes the category. \n ``s=mc <snippet_title> <category_name>`` moves a snippet to the named category. \n ``s=view <category_name>`` shows all snippets within the named category \n \n **Calling/Using Snippets** \n As long as the snippet already exists, just type ``s=p <title>``! \n You can post them nearly everywhere. \n Once the snippet is called, it will automatically delete the message that triggered it. \n \n **Multiple Snippets With The Same Name** \n If you get an error like this, it means you have multiple notes with the same name, all in different categories. \n You can use the ``s=gn <title>`` command to view the notes and what categories they're in. \n \n **Exporting** \n ``s=e <category_name>`` will export all your snippets/notes of the specified category to hastebin.com so you can copy/save them. \n If you leave the category name blank, it will export everything. This is really useful if you want to use your snippets outside of Discord! \n \n As a note: you can DM all these commands to <@726673431143383090> and manage your notes there if you don't want to do it in <#751106748676309043>." }}
