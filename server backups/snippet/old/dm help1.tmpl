{{$DMessage := (joinStr " " " \n \n **Snippet Help** \n This server allows you to make pre-formatted posts you can call with simple commands so you don't have to type similar answers every time - called snippets (or notes). \n\n __Snippets are unique to you__. \nYou're the only one who can paste and manage your snippets. \n\n You can paste snippets anywhere, but managing them can only be done in <#751106748676309043> or by DMing <@726673431143383090>. \n Using ``-sniphelp`` in <#751106748676309043> will call this DM again. \n \n **Creating a Snippet** \n ``s=an <title> <body>`` \n \n *Title* is the shortcut you will use to call the snippet. \n It cannot have spaces.\n It only supports alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens. The first character must be a letter. \n Titles must be unique. If a snippet with the same title already exists, the bot won't save it.\n \n *Body* is your actual message. \n It can have anything in it, and supports standard Discord markdown. \n You can include new lines, emoji, links, etc. \n  You can have named links by using ``[Link title](urlhere)`` \n The entire snippet is formatted as an embed preview (similar to the message that appeared in <#751106748676309043> when you typed ``-sniphelp``). \n \n **Editing or Deleting Snippets** \n ``s=en <title> <new content>`` edits your snippet. \n ``s=dn <title>`` deletes it. \nPlease note that all management functions only work in <#751106748676309043>.") }}
