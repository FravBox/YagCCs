(Optional) migrate tags\nYou used a previous tag system & want to convert them to this one.\n-# This assumes your previous tag system uses a specific db structure.\n-# If your db keys don't start with \x60tg.|\x60 then you'll have to transfer or delete tags manually.\n**This option will __NOT__ delete anything.**\nDue to yag limits, we can only transfer 4 tags at a time.\nOnce you start, you cannot stop. If you stop mid-way, you will have to \"Delete All\" before continuing later.\n## 3. Delete all\nDeletes all databases associated with this CC. Use this if you want to remove the tag system or \"reset to factory settings\".\nDue to Yag limits, we can only delete 10 (or 50 for premium servers) at a time. Continue running this command until you get a response without error.\n-# Note: this will not delete any posts in the reference tag channel, but it will break all functions associated with them.\n-# Delete the channel and/or posts manually after running this command.\n## 4. Delete tags with no posts\nUse if you accidentally deleted tag messages in the reference channel.\nThis attempts to find bad message links & delete the tags associated with them.\nDue to yag limits, you may have to run it more than once.\nIf you have the opposite problem - duplicate messages for the same tag - manually delete __the first__ (oldest) message only."}}
