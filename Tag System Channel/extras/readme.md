# Tag system extras
These are optional text commands for edge-case needs

## Change Tag author
`-tagauthor TagRefMessageURL @NewAuthor`     
Change a tag's author to someone else. Useful after migration. You can use an User ID instead of a ping if you want.      
Note this does not update the original tag reference message (it will still show the old author). If you want to update the ref post, manage the tag by saving it without actually changing anything.
