## Change Tag author
`-tagauthor TagRefMessageURL @NewAuthor`     
Change the a tag's author to someone else. Useful after migration.      
Note this does not update the original tag reference message (it will still show the old author). If you want to update the ref post, manage the tag by saving it without actually changing anything.
